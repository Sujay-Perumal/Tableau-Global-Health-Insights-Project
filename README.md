## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive and interactive dashboard built in Tableau, designed to analyze and visualize **Global Health Data**. The goal was to transform complex public health statistics into clear, actionable insights, enabling the comparison of health metrics across different regions and time periods.

The dashboard allows users to explore key indicators such as life expectancy, mortality rates, and disease prevalence, highlighting global disparities and trends.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project effectively showcases advanced expertise in **Data Visualization, Business Intelligence (BI), and Data Storytelling** using Tableau:

* **Advanced Visualization:** Implementation of geographical maps, trend lines, and custom color palettes to effectively communicate complex data patterns.
* **Calculated Fields (Tableau Prep):** Creation of custom metrics, year-over-year comparisons, and ratios essential for deep health analysis.
* **Dashboard Interactivity:** Use of **Action Filters**, **Parameters**, and drill-down capabilities to allow users to customize their view and explore data dynamically.
* **Data Storytelling:** Designing a workflow that logically moves the user from high-level global metrics to detailed, country-specific trends.
* **Data Connection & Cleaning:** Successfully connecting to and structuring a large, complex public health dataset for optimal performance in Tableau.
